- The popup manager and character creation manager needs to be fixed.
Right now it seems character creation is handling yes and no and close notice and such.
This is the popup manager's job. So, we need to move it into there and then
make the popup manager have a modular paramater this way multiple components
of the game can utilize it, not just character creation.

- Need to make a prompt manager to have parameters to be modular for prompt phase objects, instead of having the prompt phase objects themselves do the displaying and filling the prompt html with data.

Edited:
- When player creates their character:
1. pick random region
2. procedurally generate map
3. create first place
4. assign that place to player
5. update UI player's room label
6. update map to show room highlighted or dot graphic on player's place
7. write function for travel
8. when player travels, update player's place data, update ui player's place label, update player graphic on map, decrease player's fatigue, push message to text log that player traveled

- Updated the template structure of prompts/dialogues. Updated the prompt manager to sequentally move through dialogues unless an option selected specifies moving to a specific dialogue. This prompt template can be used for both linear menus or to move to specific parts of the dialogue like going back to an earlier dialogue or going towards the end. It's also useful for menus that just go from one dialogue to the next sequentially.
